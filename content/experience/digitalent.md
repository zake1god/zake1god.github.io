## Cyber Novice - Ethical Hacking - Batch 2

Stopping work doesn't make Zake lazy, to make ends meet, Zake takes the time to work as a part-time online motorcycle taxi driver. On May 13, 2023 Zake saw that there was an opportunity to register for the Fresh Graduated Academy training from [Digitalent Kominfo](https://digitalent.kominfo.go.id/). Seeing this opportunity, Zake finally decided to register and test his skills.

<br>

Zake was finally declared to have passed and was able to take part in the training on 12 to 26 June, 2023. Every day Zake attended the training until it was time for the national stage of the Ethical Hacking Essentials test, and Alhamdulillah Zake managed to get a score above the threshold.

<br>

After that there is another selection from the committee to select participants who qualify to be able to take part in the Global certification stage. Alhamdulillah again Zake was chosen to take part in global certification. Until now, we are still waiting for the training date, and Zake is currently focusing on studying to prepare himself so he can pass the Global certification stage.

On July 29 2023, Zake took the Ethical Hacker Essentials exam from the Ec Council and finally he passed with a score of 82.7. The certificate was issued with code ECC0387546912 on July 29 2023 which will then end on July 28 2026.
