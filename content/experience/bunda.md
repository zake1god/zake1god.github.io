## Description

While I was writing my thesis, I tried to work as a programmer in one of the private hospitals in Palembang. There I served as a SIMRS BackEnd at the hospital. 
Unfortunately, In August 2022 I resigned because I had to go to Tangerang to look after my parents for a few months, then January 2023 I returned to Palembang to carry out my graduation. The last project that I made is in my old github repository, which is here :
