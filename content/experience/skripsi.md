## Description
During college I studied many subjects and programming languages, of course. From here I can understand programming languages ranging from PHP, Java, until I also learned the Laravel framework. However, because of my interest in cyber security, I finally chose the topic of data security for my thesis. My thesis is entitled "Aplikasi Pengaman Data Email Menggunakan Algoritma AES Dan RC 4 Pada Komisi Penyiaran Indonesia Daerah Provinsi Sumatera Selatan Berbasis Website" or in English "mail Data Security Application Using AES And RC 4 Algorithm at the Website-Based Indonesian Broadcasting Commission, South Sumatra Province". This thesis also does not forget other subjects. Finally, I graduated with GPA: 3.65
