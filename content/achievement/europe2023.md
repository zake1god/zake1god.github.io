## Cert Europe Eu

In June 2023 I tried to find vulnerabilities on the Europe.eu website, a few days after I did my research I finally found a vulnerability which I immediately reported to the admin. The only vulnerability found is information disclosure, but still it is a vulnerability. Thanks to the vulnerability I found, my name is inducted into the [Hall Of Fame](https://www.cert.europa.eu/hall-of-fame) of their website.
