**Zaki Zarkasih Al Mustafa** or commonly known as zake is a Cyber Security Enthusiast from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© His love for the world of computers was born when he joined a community called PHL in 2016. But the knowledge he gained was never used for bad things, as evidenced by his participation in competitions such as Capture The Flag and he also worked as a programmer at Hospital.

In 2023 zake tries to focus back on the world of Cyber Security to develop his skills so that they are even better and can be useful for many people later, in 2023 zake will also become a discord member in the [Meta4Sec](https://meta4sec.com/) community because zake is very interested in the vision/mission of the community.
